## Description

The aim for this project is to create a game. The game must be rendered in a browser using DOM manipulation techniques. The game must have clear UI so the player is able to understand how to play and know if they have won or lost. The game will be created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and all the files myst be orginized properly. The game must include all the features which the original game has.

## Getting Started/Code Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the index.html with Live Server
3. Enjoy the game


## Timeframe & Working Team (Solo/Pair/Group)

I started working on this solo project on 31st March and finish on the 4th April


## Technologies Used

Front End

  - HTML
  - JavaScript
  - CSS

Other Tools

  - GitHub
  - Visual Studio Code


## Brief

MVP

  - Render the game in the browser using the DOM manipulation techniques demonstrated in lecture.
  - Include win/loss logic and render win/loss messages in HTML. The game you chose must have a win/lose condition.
  - Include separate HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JavaScript data files organized in an appropriate directory structure.
  - Include all required features specific to your game. Game-specific required features are defined in the Required Features column in the table in the Recommended Games document, or as discussed with your instructor. If you want to build a game that is not on this list, you will need to present and discuss your game’s features with the instructional team for approval.
  - The game is deployed online so that the rest of the world can play it.


## Planning


![wireframe](image-1.png)

Here is how I wanted the game to look, I wanted to keep the layout simple and make it easy for the player to visually see the important aspects of the game.

I created a trello board which allows me to set deadlines and layed out what I would be working on each day. Doing this helped as I neved felt rushed and as I was working alone I knew what needed to be done before I could start working on the next part. 

User Story

1: Game Start

  - When the game loads I want the player to see the instrustions on how to play along with a clear buttons which tells the player to start the game.

2: Game

  - When the player begins the game a timer should appear to show how long they have been playing
  - The 10 x 10 board will apear in the center of the screen

3: First Selection

  - Once the player clicks on a given tile is should either
        - Show a blank tile and cascade and fill all connection empty tiles
        - Show the number of mines around the tile, clearing displayed in the center
        - Show a mine which will take them to the game over screen

4: Flag Possible Mines

  - The player should be able to right click on a slow which they think has a mine inside
  - This will be clearly displayed to the player

5: Win Condition

  - Once the player has cleared the board which only the 10 blank tiles with mines behind the player will be take to the win screen
        - The player will be greeted with a victory message
        - The time it has taken them to win
        - Play again button will be displayed to allow the player to play again

6: Lose Condition

  - If the player clicks on a tile with a mine behind they will be taken to the lose screen
        - The player will be shown the they have lost
        - A button to play again will apear


## Build/Code Process

Instructions

The Build/Code Process will be the longest section of your ReadMe and will be most insightful to the engineers that review them. This is where you will discuss the steps you took to code the project.

You want to see your ReadMes as a way to walk the engineers through your approach and problem solving from the start of the project through to the end.

You'll need to include a minimum of 3-4 code snippets, highlighting code you're particularly proud of and these code snippets will have descriptions on what you did, how and why to set the context of the snippet you include. These explanations are important for the engineers, as they will want to understand what you did and the reasoning behind the steps you took.

You don't need to document every single thing you coded, but walk them through the key sections of the project build.

For any group project, you will just focus on your contributions. 

Some people will document the build/code process by discussing the key stages they worked on. Others will do a day by day guide. It’s entirely up to you how you structure this, as long as you discuss all the key things above.

## Challenges

Instructions

Challenges are great for showing your learning journey and problem solving, and this is a section that many engineers will check out. Every day of your engineering career you’ll encounter challenges, this is part of your growth and development. It’s the challenges you encounter that helps you become a stronger and more competent engineer. 

Here you will detail any particular challenges you encountered as you were coding the project. 

Questions to answer here:

What technical challenges did you come across? 
Why were these challenges? 
What problem solving did you do to rectify them?
Team dynamics/ Project management
Tools/Tech you used

Insert your Challenges here:




## Wins

Instructions

The Wins section is your opportunity to highlight the aspects of your project you are most proud of. See this as your chance to showcase these parts of your projects to the engineers reading your ReadMes.

Things you could discuss here:

Interesting problem solving you did
Strong sections of code
Collaboration with other team members
Visual design of the project

## Key Learnings/Takeaways

Instructions

This section is one of the other most important parts of your ReadMe from an engineers’ perspective and helps to differentiate each of you from your classmates and team members. 

Engineers love to understand what you learn from each project and how it has shaped you as an engineer. 

See this as your opportunity to show the engineers how your skills grew during each project sprint. 

Things you could discuss here:

What Technologies/Tools do you now feel more confident with? Tell them specifically what you learnt about these. 
What engineering processes did you become more comfortable with? Standups? Pair programming? Project management? Tell them what you learnt from these processes?

## Bugs

Instructions

If you have any bugs in your project, it’s important that you flag them in your ReadMe. This helps the engineers reviewing your projects to understand that you are aware that there are issues - if you don’t flag these, then they won’t have that visibility that you know these problems are in your code and it can result in them not having a full understanding of your technical knowledge. 

In either sentences or bullets, explain what the bugs are.

If you have no bugs, you can leave this section blank.

## Future Improvements

Instructions

It’s common to get to the end of your project and have ideas on what you would do if you have more time, as well as how you might improve it. 

If you do, you should detail this here. It’s great to give that context on potential future improvements, to share your creative or technical ideas with the engineers reading your ReadMes.

In either sentences or bullets, explain what your future improvements would be.
